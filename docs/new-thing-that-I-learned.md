# New Things That I learned

___

## Background:

This project started as a way to improve my technical skills outside of work. My first task was to write unit tests,
which I had some trouble doing since it was my first time. So I came home, wrote a basic backend and started writing
unit tests. From there, almost every task I had I tried to replicate it in my project, honing and improving my skills.

## Devops:

- **Docker**:
    - Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.
    - I used Docker to create a development environment for my project. I used docker-compose to create a
      multi-container environment.
- **AWS**:
    - I use S3 bucket to store images.
    - I plan on incorporating DynamoDB for NoSQL database, SQS for messages queue, and SNS for notifications, Lambda for
      serverless computing, and API Gateway for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing APIs at any
      scale.
- **CI/CD**:
    - I used GitHub Actions to automate the CI/CD pipeline.
    - I plan on using Jenkins for CI/CD.
    - I Use Playwright for end-to-end testing.

## Backend:

      testing.
    - I plan on working to include several databases, and AWS tools in my design
